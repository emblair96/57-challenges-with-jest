## Description

The purpose of this repo is to track my progress through the exercises found in the book _Exercises for Programmers: 57 Challenges to Develop Your Coding Skills_ by Brian P. Hogan. I am finding ways to continue to strengthen my skillset as a software engineer and specifically focusing on test-driven development (TDD) here, writing tests for each exercise using the Jest framework. Thanks for stopping by!
